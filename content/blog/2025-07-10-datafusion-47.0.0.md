We’re excited to announce the release of **Apache DataFusion 47.0.0**! This new version represents a significant
milestone for the project, packing in a wide range of improvements and fixes. You can find the complete details in the
full [changelog](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/branch-47/dev/changelog/47.0.0.md). We’ll highlight the most
important changes below and guide you through upgrading.

## Breaking Changes

DataFusion 47.0.0 brings a few **breaking changes** that may require adjustments to your code as described in
the [Upgrade Guide](https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/upgrading.html). Here are the most notable ones:

- [Upgrades to arrow-rs and arrow-parquet 55.0.0 and object_store 0.12.0](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15466):
  Several APIs are changed in the underlying arrow and parquet libraries to use a u64 instead of usize to better support
  WASM. This requires converting from usize to u64 occasionally as well as changes to ObjectStore implementations such as
```Rust
impl Objectstore {
    ...

    // The range is now a u64 instead of usize
    async fn get_range(&self, location: &Path, range: Range<u64>) -> ObjectStoreResult<Bytes> {
        self.inner.get_range(location, range).await
    }
    
    ...
    
    // the lifetime is now 'static instead of `_ (meaning the captured closure can't contain references)
    // (this also applies to list_with_offset)
    fn list(&self, prefix: Option<&Path>) -> BoxStream<'static, ObjectStoreResult<ObjectMeta>> {
        self.inner.list(prefix)
    }
}
```
- [DisplayFormatType::TreeRender](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14914):
  Implementations of `ExecutionPlan` must also provide a description in the `DisplayFormatType::TreeRender` format to
  provide support for the new [tree style explains](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/explain.html#tree-format-default).
  This can be the same as the existing `DisplayFormatType::Default`.

## Performance Improvements

DataFusion 47.0.0 comes numerous performance enhancements across the board. Here are some of the noteworthy
optimizations in this release:

- **Improve performance of `FIRST_VALUE` and `LAST_VALUE`:** The `FIRST_VALUE` and `LAST_VALUE` functions have
  improved by implementing a GroupsAccumulator for them. When cardinality is high using a groups accumulator
  improves the performance of these functions significantly:

  | sql                                                                                                     | 46.0.0 | 47.0.0 |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------| ------- |
  | `select id2, id4, first_value(v1 order by id2, id4) as r2 from '~/h2o_100m.parquet' group by id2, id4;` | 35.6s | 7s |
  (PR's [#15266](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15266)
  and [#15542](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15542) by [UBarney](https://github.com/UBarney)).
- **Improve performance of `MIN`, `MAX` and `AVG` for durations:** Similar to the above improvement a GroupsAccumulator was
  implemented for `MIN`, `MAX` and `AVG` functions to improve their performance.
  (PRs [#15322](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15322) and [#15748](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15748)
  by [shriti2522](https://github.com/shruti2522)).
- **Add short circuit evaluation for `AND` and `OR`:** For some queries it is possibly to skip the evaluation of
  the right operand if the left is known to be false (`AND`) or true (`OR`). In some cases this can result in
  [significant performance improvements](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/11212#issuecomment-2753584617).
  (PRs [#15462](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15462) and [#15694](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15694)
  by [acking-you](https://github.com/acking-you)).
- **Improve TopK exit optimization for partially sorted input:** TopK had perviously implemented an early termination
  optimization (TopK) only for fully sorted data. However, many real-world datasets are only partially sorted
  (for example, a time-series dataset sorted by day but not within each day). This improvement extends that optimization
  to partially sorted data based on a common prefix between the input ordering and the query’s requested ordering
  (PR [#15563](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15563) by [geoffreyclaude](https://github.com/geoffreyclaude)).

## Highlighted New Features

### Tree style explains

In previous releases the output of an explain was rendered as a formatted table
with all the details included. This was succinct but was often hard to read
especially with queries that included joins or unions having multiple children.

In DataFusion 47.0.0 the output of an explain is now rendered in a visual tree style
that is much easier to quickly understand.

```
> explain select * from t1 inner join t2 on t1.ti=t2.ti;

| plan_type     | plan                                                       |

Thanks to [irenjj](https://github.com/irenjj) for the initial work in PR [#14677](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/14677)
and many others for completing the [followup epic](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14914)

### SQL VARCHAR defaults to Utf8View

In previous releases when a column was created in sql the column would be mapped to the `Utf8` data type. In this release
the sql `varchar` columns will be mapped to `Utf8View`:
```sql
create table foo(x varchar);
0 row(s) fetched.

> describe foo;
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| column_name | data_type | is_nullable |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| x           | Utf8View  | YES         |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
```
This change reflected the default of `Utf8View` used when reading parquet files as it is faster in most cases.

### Tracing context propagation in spawned tasks

This release introduces a general mechanism enabling DataFusion to propagate user-defined context (such as tracing spans,
logging, or metrics) across thread boundaries without depending on any specific instrumentation library.

In previous releases tasks spawned on new threads — such as those performing repartitioning or parquet file reads —
would lose thread-local context, making instrumentation challenging for users. The introduced approach addresses this
gap by allowing users to inject custom instrumentation via the new JoinSetTracer trait. This ensures context is preserved
seamlessly and keeping DataFusion lightweight by not adding any direct instrumentation dependencies.

```Rust
/// A simple tracer that ensures any spawned task or blocking closure
/// inherits the current span via `in_current_span`.
struct SpanTracer;

/// Implement the `JoinSetTracer` trait so we can inject instrumentation
/// for both async futures and blocking closures.
impl JoinSetTracer for SpanTracer {
    /// Instruments a boxed future to run in the current span. The future's
    /// return type is erased to `Box<dyn Any + Send>`, which we simply
    /// run inside the `Span::current()` context.
    fn trace_future(
        &self,
        fut: BoxFuture<'static, Box<dyn Any + Send>>,
    ) -> BoxFuture<'static, Box<dyn Any + Send>> {
        fut.in_current_span().boxed()
    }

    /// Instruments a boxed blocking closure by running it inside the
    /// `Span::current()` context.
    fn trace_block(
        &self,
        f: Box<dyn FnOnce() -> Box<dyn Any + Send> + Send>,
    ) -> Box<dyn FnOnce() -> Box<dyn Any + Send> + Send> {
        let span = Span::current();
        Box::new(move || span.in_scope(f))
    }
}

...
set_join_set_tracer(&SpanTracer).expect("Failed to set tracer");
...
```
An example showcasing how to use this new functionality can be found in the [DataFusion examples](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/datafusion-examples/examples/tracing.rs).
