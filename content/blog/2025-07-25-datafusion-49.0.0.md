## Introduction

We are very proud to announce [DataFusion 49.0.0]. This blog highlights some of the
many major improvements since we released [DataFusion 48.0.0]. This new version
represents a significant milestone for the project, packing in a wide range of
improvements and fixes. You can find the complete details in the full [changelog].

[DataFusion 49.0.0]: https://crates.io/crates/datafusion/49.0.0
[DataFusion 48.0.0]: https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/07/18/datafusion-48.0.0/
[changelog]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/branch-49/dev/changelog/49.0.0.md

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusionâ€™s primary design
goal] is to accelerate the creation of other data centric systems, it has a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe library],
[python library] and [command line SQL tool].

[apache datafusion]: https://datafusion.apache.org/
[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
[apache arrow]: https://arrow.apache.org
[DataFusionâ€™s primary design goal]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/introduction.html#project-goals
[dataframe library]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/dataframe.html
[python library]: https://datafusion.apache.org/python/
[command line SQL tool]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/

DataFusion's core thesis is that as a community, together we can build much more
advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could do alone.
Without DataFusion, highly performant vectorized query engines would remain
the domain of a few large companies and world-class research institutions.
With DataFusion, we can all build on top of a shared foundation, and focus on
what makes our projects unique.

## Community Growth  ðŸ“ˆ

In the last few months, between `46.0.0` and `49.0.0`, our community continues to grow in new and exciting ways.

1. We added several PMC members and new committers: [berkay], [xudong963] and [timsaucer] joined the PMC,
   [blaginin], [milenkovicm], [adriangb] and [kosiew] joined as committers. See the [mailing list] for more details.
2. In the [core DataFusion repo] alone we reviewed and accepted almost fixme PRs from fixme different
   committers, created over fixme issues and closed fixme of them ðŸš€. All changes are listed in the detailed
   [changelogs].
3. DataFusion published a number of blog posts including [User defined Window Functions], Optimizing SQL (and DataFrames)
   in DataFusion [part 1], [part 2] and [Using Rust async for Query Execution and Cancelling Long-Running Queries].

## Breaking Changes

DataFusion 49.0.0 brings a few **breaking changes** that may require adjustments to your code as described in
the [Upgrade Guide](https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/upgrading.html#datafusion-49-0-0). Here are some notable ones:

- fixme 

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

DataFusion continues to focus on enhancing performance as can be seen in the ClickBench Benchmark:

width="100%"
class="img-responsive"
alt="ClickBench performance results over time for DataFusion"
/>

**Figure 1**: ClickBench performance improved over 33% between DataFusion 33
(released Nov. 2023) and DataFusion 49 (released July. 2025).

Here are some noteworthy optimizations since DataFusion 48 was released:

- **Equivalence system overhaul:** The equivalence system was rewritten to reduce computational complexity leading to
  much faster planning times in some cases, especially those with a [large number of columns](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16217#pullrequestreview-2891941229)
  (PR [#16217](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16217) by [ozankabak](https://github.com/ozankabak)).
- **Improve TopK dynamic filtering pushdown:**

### Equivalence system overhaul

### Spill to disk file compression

https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16268

### Parquet modular encryption

https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16351

### TopK dynamic filter pushdown

For queries such as `select * from data order by timestamp desc limit 10`
where there could be a large number of parquet files that might need to be scanned to find the top 10 rows. With this
optimization it's possible to pushdown filtering such that only the files that might include the requested rows (as
determined by file metadata such as min and max values for timestamp) are looked at. This can drastically improve
query performance (We've seen over 1.5x improvement for some tpch style queries)
(PR [#15770](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15770) by [adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb)).

## Upgrade Guide and Changelog

Upgrading to 49.0.0 should be straightforward for most users, but do review the
[Upgrade Guide for DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/upgrading.html) for detailed
steps and code changes. The upgrade guide covers breaking changes and provides code snippets to help with the
transition. For a comprehensive list of all changes, please refer to the [changelog] for 49.0.0 which
enumerates every merged PR in this release, including many smaller fixes and improvements that we couldnâ€™t
cover in this post.

## How to Get Involved

DataFusion is not a project built or driven by a single person, company, or
foundation. Rather, our community of users and contributors work together to
build a shared technology that none of us could have built alone.

If you are interested in joining us we would love to have you. You can try out
DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and let us know how it goes,
contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or a PR with documentation,
tests or code. A list of open issues suitable for beginners is [here] and you
can find how to reach us on the [communication doc].
